<p align="center"><img src="banner.png"></p>


## Context
Animations on a website can elevate the user experience and demonstrate your prowess as a developer. Landing pages for a development/tech company and developer portfolios often showcase various types of animations on a scroll, click, or hover. Frequently, such sites will also execute an animation when the user navigates to a new page. Such an animation is called a page transition.

### Examples
Below are a few examples of advanced page transitions:

## Set Up
- Fork and clone this repository
- Open `DLVR-Page-Animations/transition-site` in VS Code
- Open any one of the HTML files in the browser using Live Server 


## Your Task
- You've been given the starter code to a website with 8 unique HTML pages that all have the same `<nav>` bar and stylesheet
- Each page's `<body>` element has a unqiue id, indicative of the animation you will build
- Using the CSS file (`styles/main.css`) create animations for each page's `<body>` element - the animations should run when the page is loaded
- The first page transition has been done for you
